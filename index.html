                    <p class="shortbio">Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I'm Xavier. I first experienced coding when I was 10 years old. My dad was a blue collar worker who put in a lot of hours to provide for me and my siblings . My mother tended to our home and also cared for my brother because of his disablities. Money was tight, so my parents could not afford a new computer. Because I expressed interest in computers, my mother would take me to thrift stores to frankenstein a pc build with whatever Tandy or Mac parts we could find.<br><br>
                    The problem with such computers is that each hard drive was wiped clean! I was too young to understand why, so I remember bringing different hardware home only to be greeted by a DOS screen. I did not know it then, but I was inputting commands, and I admit, smacking away at keys hoping to get a response from the computer. Often I would generate some sort of response, but I was not able to program the computer. I did however find floppy disk games at a later visit, and was able to get games running from the DOS screen. I was a happy camper.<br><br>
                    I spent most of my adult career in the martial arts industry. I worked my way up from assistant instructor to chief instructor, manager, and even opened a location for my employer. Over the years, I developed my problem solving skills, as well as soft skills to effectively communicate not just with students and clients, but also with teammates. I’ve had to channel my creativity for class plans, presentations, and marketing materials using tools like Photoshop.<br><br>
                    In 2016 I left my employer to start my own martial arts school business. Using my creative skills as well as my willingness to learn new skills to adapt, I developed my own business website right before launch.<br><br>
                    After 15 years in the martial arts industry, I am content with what I’ve accomplished. I am excited for new challenges and wish to switch over to the software engineering industry. I enjoy helping people by giving them the tools to succeed.  I can’t wait to be a part of a team that creates amazing things, and as a result solves problems to improve UX. Thanks again for visiting my page. If you would like to contact me, I can be reached via email below.<br>
                    <br><br>
                    Best Regards,<br>
                    -Xavier Julian Rodriguez
